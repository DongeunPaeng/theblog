## The Blog

#### Created by Dongeun Paeng

The Blog project is my personal blog built with React.<br>
This project will include the following steps.<br>
The whole process will evolve continuously.<br><br>

I'll be building the website and learning React at the same time.<br>
All the sources I refer to will be on my 'da Vinci' page.
